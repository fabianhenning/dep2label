# Viable Dependency Parsing as Sequence Labeling

We recast dependency parsing as a sequence labeling problem 
where each input word from a sentence is represented as a label 
using one of four encodings. Our BILSTM-based models yield fast and accurate dependency 
parsing without using any traditional parsing algorithms. The repository contains source 
code for the paper "Viable Dependency Parsing as Sequence Labeling" that has been accepted
by NAACL 2019. 

#### How does Dependency Parsing as Sequence Labeling work in short?

###### ENCODING

Each input token is encoded into a label that preserves information about its head and relation.

##### Types of encoding with examples
 
![encodings](https://github.com/mstrise/seq2label/blob/master/figs/encodings.png)

1. __Naive positional encoding__: encodes the real index position in the sentence of the head. A label
 ```2_nsubj``` for the token _Alice_
means "the head of the word _Alice_ is at index 2 with the relation nsubj"
2. __Relative positional encoding__: encodes the difference between the index position of the head
and its dependent (- sign when the head is on the left side of the word and + sign otherwise).
A label  ```+1_nsubj``` for the token _Alice_
means "the head of the word _Alice_ is at index position +1 to the right from that word with the relation nsubj"
3. __Relative PoS-based encoding__: encodes the distance of the head from its dependent in terms of number of
words with a given PoS tag
(- sign when the head is on the left side of the word and + sign otherwise).
A label ```V_+1_nsubj``` for the token _Alice_
means "the head of the word _Alice_ is the first word to the right with a PoS tag V, and their relation is nsubj"
4. __Bracketing-based encoding__: represents dependency trees using a regular expression that encodes dependency arcs
as brackets. 
A label ```<\>_dobj``` for the token _apple_
means "the word _apple_ is the head of the preceding word indicated by```<\ ``` and has an incoming arc from a word
somewhere to the left ```>``` with the relation dobj".

More detailed explanation of the encodings can be found in the paper, referenced below.

An example line from a file in the 
[CONLL format](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html): ```1    Alice   _   NNP NNP _   2   nsubj   _   _       ```
can be transformed with ```encoding 3``` into a new format (token + its label) that will be fed into [NCRF++](https://github.com/jiesutd/NCRFpp):```Alice    V_+1_nsubj    ```


###### NCRF++

We use [NCRF++](https://github.com/jiesutd/NCRFpp): An Open-source Neural Sequence Labeling Toolkit that
 we slightly 
modified. It is recommended to familiarize oneself with this system and its architecture for better understanding.


###### DECODING

As the last step, the output of [NCRF++](https://github.com/jiesutd/NCRFpp) is decoded and transformed back to the 
CONLL 
format. Additionally, the output is postprocessed in order to assure that each sentence is well-formed (for instance 
that the 
system only outputs acyclic syntactic trees). A more detailed explanation can be found in the paper.


## Requirements

It is recommended to create a virtual environment in order to keep the installed packages separate to avoid conflicts
 with 
other programs.

* ```Python 2.7```
* ```PyTorch 0.3```

The program was tested on Ubuntu 16.04, Python 2.7.12, PyTorch 0.3.1.

## Usage

#### Train a model

```bash
python main.py --train-config $PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE_FOR_TRAINING --decode-config $PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE_FOR_DECODING --train-gold $PATH_TO_GOLD_FILE_TRAIN_SET --dev-gold $PATH_TO_GOLD_FILE_DEV_SET --encoded-input-training $PATH_TO_FILE_WITH_ENCODING_OF_TRAIN_SET --encoded-input-dev $PATH_TO_FILE_WITH_ENCODING_OF_DEV_SET --encoding-type $TYPE_OF_ENCODING --eval-type $FORMAT_OF_THE_FILES --postag-type $TYPE_OF_POSTAGS
```
* ```--train-config``` an example of a [config file for training](https://github.com/mstrise/seq2label/blob/master/config/train.config)
* ```--decode-config``` an example of a [config file for decoding](https://github.com/mstrise/seq2label/blob/master/config/decode.config)
* ```--train-gold```  and ```--dev_gold``` have to be in [CONLL format](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html)
* ```--encoded-input-training```  and ```--encoded-input-dev``` files to which the system writes tokens and 
their encoded 
labels that will be used as an input
 for NCRF++
* ```--encoding-type``` a type of encoding that one wants to use: ```1```, ```2```, ```3``` or ```4```. Encoding ```3```
 is 
set as default for best performance
* ```--eval-type``` a format of the file that one wants to use: ```CONLL``` (for PTB) or ```CONLLU``` (for UD). 
Different 
scripts are used to evaluate them. The first one excludes the punctuation.
* ```--postag-type``` a type of PoS tags that one wants to use as a self-defined feature: ```UPOS```: *Universal 
part-of-speech tag* or 
```XPOS```: *Language-specific part-of-speech tag* 

In this work, the same [pretrained word embeddings](https://github.com/clab/lstm-parser/) for English and 
Chinese were used as in the paper: 
[Transition-Based Dependency Parsing with Stack Long Short-Term Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.08075). For other 
languages we used [pretrained word embeddings](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-1989)
 from CoNLL 2017 Shared Task.
 
 The training config file above contains the hyperparameters for the 
 ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$P^{\mathrm{C}}_{\mathrm{2,800}}$) model presented in the paper. The best 
 model will be saved as "XXX_best.model" based on the highest UAS score on the development set.

#### Parse with a pre-trained model

```bash
python main.py  --decode-config $PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE_FOR_DECODING --input $PATH_TO_THE_INPUT_FILE --test-gold $PATH_TO_THE_GOLD_FILE --output $PATH_TO_THE_OUTPUT_FILE --encoding-type $TYPE_OF_ENCODING --eval-type $EVAL $FORMAT_OF_THE FILES --postag-type $TYPE_OF_POSTAGS
```
* ```--decode-config``` an example of a [config file for decoding of the best model](https://github.com/mstrise/seq2label/blob/master/config/decode_best_model.config)
* ```--input``` a file in the [CONLL format](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html) with either gold or predicted 
segmentation 
and PoS tags  
* ```--test-gold``` a gold file for evaluation
